# Haskell Interpreter for Magda

The Haskell Interpreter for Magda is based on J. Kusmierek's PhD 
dissertation, which contains the formal definition of Magda, an Object
Oriented, mixin-based, statically typed, imperative language [^mixiny]. 

## Building the interpreter 

For the building process the ghc compiler is required, follow the
instructions on its project's homepage in order to install ghc for your
distribution.

In order to download and build the interpreter follow these steps:

 1. Install parsec, needed for parsing, follow the
    instructions in the dedicated hackage page[^parsec]. The easiest
    way to achieve this is through the package manager \texttt{cabal},
    using:
	
```{.sh}
 $ cabal install parsec
```

 2. Clone the project repository.

```{.sh}
 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/magda-lang/hi-magda.git
```

 3. Then move in the project folder and simply run \texttt{make} to
	build the binary.

```{.sh}
 $ cd hi-magda
 $ make
```

 4. Install the interpreter. 
	
```{.sh}
 $ sudo make install
```

 5. Run your Magda programs!
 
```{.sh}
 $ magda <your-program-filename-here>
```

## Downloading the interpreter

To download and install the latest version (v.1.1) binary, available
only for the linux-x86_64 platform, run:

```{.sh}
 $ curl -o /usr/local/bin/magda https://gitlab.com/magda-lang/hi-magda/uploads/83edb7cbad1e06ec5ba1433e35c25c73/magda-v1.1-linux-x86_64
```
